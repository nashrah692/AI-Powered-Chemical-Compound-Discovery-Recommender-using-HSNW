Deliverable 3
In this round you have to do the following
1. Integrate RAG in all the three LLM based Recommendation System
Now you have a total of six (6) Recommendation Systems
a. Three LLM based Recommendation Systems
b. Three LLM based Recommendation Systems with RAG Integrations
2. Evaluate the recommendation systems using the Metrics in the file “Metrics”
Deliverables:
1. Deliverable 1
a. Report (MS Word or Latex)
b. Images in Editable format
2. Deliverable 2
a. Report (Complete in all aspects)
b. Diagrams
i. Diagrams of the whole process from preprocessing to recommendation.
1. Remember that the preprocessing diagram is the part of
Deliverable 1, therefore in this diagram, the preprocessing will be
represented by a single box, and an arrow will be drawn to the next
step in the process.

ii. (Chart 1 and 2 are compulsory, in the rest, you have to provide 6 charts of
your own choice or that fits with your recommendation system). (File
attached “Charts”)
iii. You have to discuss in two sentences that why you choose that chart.
iv. Discuss each graph/chart/diagram in minimum six meaningful sentences.
c. Pseudocode (Algorithm)
i. Preprocessing
ii. Complete Pseudocode (LSH/HSNW/FAISS/Scann + Embedding + LLM
Tuning + Recommendation)

d. Code
i. (All codes (Each file should have a meaningful name))

3. Deliverable 3
a. Report
i. Discuss the complete process of the remaining three LLMs, i.e., RAG
based LLMs. The discussion must be step wise and architecture based.
ii. Remember that the Retrieval system in RAG must be tuned properly and
discussed thoroughly along the justification of using that specific tuning
mechanism for your respective recommended system.

b. Diagram
i. Diagrams of the whole process from preprocessing to recommendation.
1. Remember that the preprocessing diagram is the part of
Deliverable 1, therefore in this diagram, the preprocessing will be
represented by a single box, and an arrow will be drawn to the next
step in the process. RAG will also be represented as a box.

3
ii. (Chart 1 and 2 are compulsory, in the rest, you have to provide 6 charts of
your own choice or that fits with your recommendation system). (File
attached “Charts”)
iii. Complete diagrams of RAG with its tuning process.
c. Pseudocode (Algorithm)
i. Preprocessing
ii. Complete Pseudocode (LSH/HSNW/FAISS/Scann + Embedding + RAG
& LLM Tuning + Recommendation)

d. Code
i. (All codes (Each file should have a meaningful name))
e. Evaluate the recommendation systems using the Metrics in the file “Metrics”
i. There will be three tables
1. Assessing Strength of Recommendations
a. In this you are given 9 metrics, you can evaluate the six
recommendation systems using any of the six metrics.

2. Table 2
a. You are given 7 metrics, evaluate all the six
recommendation systems using any of the 4 metrics that are
closely align with your work

3. Table 3
a. You are given 5 metrics, evaluate all the six
recommendation systems using any of the 3 metrics that are
closely align with your work

4. Table 4
a. You are given 5 metrics, evaluate all the six
recommendation systems using any of the 3 metrics that are
closely align with your work

5. Table 5
a. You have to evaluate MSE, RMSE and F1 score for all the
six recommendation systems.
6. Bar chart for each of these 5 tables
