ROUND 2 TASKS AND DELIVERABLES

R2.1: Apply the assigned algorithm (such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Hierarchical
Sparse Nearest Neighbor (HSNW), etc.) to compute the buckets for similar vectors.
R2.2: Tune each of the three Large Language Models (LLMs) separately, ensuring that each is
optimized. For each of these models, generate and save their corresponding diagrams or graphs.
R2.3: Tuning process of these models will be two steps
1. Based on your dataset
2. Based on your datasets and incorporation of the information derived from the computed
buckets.
R2.4: Finally, perform the recommendation process based on the results of the previous steps.

Deliverable 2: Requirements
A. Labelled Diagrams
  • Provide labelled diagrams for each of the following tasks: R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, and R2.4.
  • These diagrams should be clear, labeled, and detailed.
B. Explanations for R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, and R2.4
  • Each explanation will be divided into two parts:
    1. Conceptual Level: Provide a high-level overview of the processes, explaining their
    purpose and importance.
    2. Programming Level: Provide detailed insights into the technical steps involved,
    focusing on the code and algorithmic approach.
C. Pseudocode
  • Provide a complete pseudocode outlining the entire process, demonstrating how the tasks are
  implemented and how data flows through the system.
D. Code
  • Submit all code that implements the steps and tasks outlined in R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, and R2.4.
E. Editable Format Diagrams
  • Deliver all diagrams from R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, and R2.4 in an editable format (e.g., vector
  images, or editable .svg files).
F.Editable Format Diagrams from Deliverable 1
  • Provide all diagrams from Deliverable 1 in an editable format.
G. You have to demonstrate for R2.2 & R2.3, what is the difference in terms of computation
  • When you Take recommendation from LLM tuned based on your dataset
  • When you Take recommendation from LLM tuned based on your dataset and knowledge derived
  from LSH, HSNW or any of the assigned algorithm
  
Note:
• R2.2 will need to be repeated for each of the three Large Language Models (LLMs).
• No AI-generated text will be accepted for this assignment.
• Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Ensure all work is original and properly referenced if
necessary.
• Remember that it has to be a recommendation system rather than a searching platform.
