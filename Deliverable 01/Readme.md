This Deliverable consists of 5 steps in code:
- Step 01: Data Loading and Pre-Processing
- Step 02: Generating Fingerprints (Morgan Fingerprints)
- Step 03: GNN for Fingerprint Embedding (GIN)
- Step 04: HNSW Index for GNN Embeddings
- Step 05: HNSW Search Function


REQUIREMENTS:

How you performed embeddings
- A complete, well structured, and labelled diagram.
- A complete write up on the process that you shown in this diagram

Motivation
- Why are you using this process to compute the embeddings.
(A single paragraph with 8 to 10 lines)

Preprocessing
- A complete, well structured, and labelled diagram.
- A complete write up on the process that you shown in this diagram
(Minimum Two pages)
